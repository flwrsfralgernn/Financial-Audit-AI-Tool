Cal Poly Travel Expense Audit AI Tool

This project is an AI-powered system designed to automate and improve Cal Polyâ€™s travel expense audit process. It reviews employee travel data exported from Concur and uses a large language model (Claude 3 Sonnet via Amazon Bedrock) to identify policy violations and exceptions based on CSU and Cal Poly travel rules.

Main Features:

Upload raw Concur Excel reports

Clean and format data automatically

Group expenses by employee and report

Send expense data to Claude AI for review

Detect violations and exceptions

Generate color-coded Excel reports:

Red = Violation

Yellow = Exception

Simple user interface (built with Tkinter)

Technologies Used:

Python

Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)

Pandas

OpenPyXL

Tkinter

Boto3

How It Works:

You import the raw Excel file.

The program cleans and prepares the data.

It selects a few employee reports at random.

Each group is sent to Claude AI with a custom prompt.

Claude returns a list of flagged entries with reasons.

The result is saved as an Excel file in the audit_reports folder.

Setup:

Install the required Python packages

Set up your AWS Bedrock access credentials in config.py

Run the app using python app.py
