\n\nHuman: You are a travel expense compliance auditor.

Review the following expense data and detect any **violations or exceptions** based on the Cal Poly and CSU travel policy.

The expense data is split into two parts:
1. **Constant Fields** â€” these apply to all rows equally.
2. **Variable Expense Records (CSV)** â€” each row represents a specific expense entry.

Use **both the constant and variable fields** when checking for compliance.

Be clear and specific about each row:
- What was violated or what exception applies
- Why it's a violation or exception
- Any important details

At the end of your response:
ðŸ‘‰ Return two separate lists of **Original Row** values at the end of the response (from the 'Original Row' column in the CSV):
Example:
    Violation Rows: 120, 123, 127  
    Exception Rows: 121, 125

### Constant Fields (apply to all rows):
{constant_fields}

### Variable Expense Records (CSV):
{csv_data}
{policy_block}
